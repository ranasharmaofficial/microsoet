                                       <p>Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</p>
                                       <p>Overview</p>
                                       <p>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on growciti. However there
                                          may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Ebuild
                                          Bazaar, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes
                                          between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
                                       <p>What is a 'dispute'?</p>
                                       <p>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in
                                          connection with a transaction on the Platform.</p>
                                       <p>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</p>
                                       <p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the
                                          Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not
                                          being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
                                       <p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should
                                          attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a
                                          dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until
                                          the issue is resolved.</p>
                                       <p>How is a 'dispute' created?</p>
                                       <p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can contact us through this link :
                                          <a href="javascript:void(0);">ebuildbazaar.com</a>, while the Seller can write
                                          to ss@growciti.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised
                                          at a particular transaction level.</p>
                                       <p>What are the various types of 'disputes'?</p>
                                       <p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
                                       <ol>
                                          <li>Wrong item received</li>
                                          <li>Item Not as described</li>
                                          <li>Damaged or Seal broken on Product</li>
                                          <li>Part/Accessory missing</li>
                                          <li>Item not Compatible</li>
                                          <li>Seller Description/Specification Wrong</li>
                                          <li>Defective (Functional issues)</li>
                                          <li>Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice</li>
                                       </ol>
                                       <p>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a
                                          dispute, then growciti will try to mediate and resolve the dispute
                                          between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a
                                          refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute
                                          is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.</p>
                                       <p>Buyer Protection Program</p>
                                       <p>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a
                                          replacement, growciti will actively work towards reaching a resolution.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully

                                          Seller is not resolved. growciti's Customer Support team will look into
                                          the case to check for possible fraud and if the Buyer has been
                                          blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the Platform. Only after
                                          verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.</p>
                                       <p>CS team will not facilitate a conference call, CS team acts as the bridge
                                          between customer and seller. </p>

                                       <p>Buyer Eligibility and Restrictions</p>

                                       <p>To be able to take advantage of the Buyer Protection Program, Buyers should
                                          first contact the Seller and attempt to resolve the issue. If the Buyer
                                          doesn't hear from the Seller or is unable to resolve the issue with the Seller
                                          even after contact, a dispute can be raised with growciti by contacting

                                       </p>
                                       <p>If the Buyer has already initiated chargeback through the credit card issuing
                                          bank, it will not be covered under Buyer Protection Program, though in such
                                          cases a Seller can file a claim through the Seller Protection Program.</p>
                                       <p>Blacklisted and Blocked Buyers are not covered by the Buyer Protection
                                          Program.</p>
                                       <p>Buyers who have reached their maximum lifetime limit for claims are also not
                                          eligible. Buyers can make a maximum of 5 claims per year on growciti. If

                                          guarantee/warranty to Buyers for products sold on growciti against
                                          technical/manufacturing defects.</p>
                                       <p>Raising disputes against Sellers does not automatically entitle the Buyer to a

                                       <p>Decisions made by growciti under the Buyer Protection Program shall be

                                       <p>growciti has put in place growciti Infringement Verification process
                                          so that intellectual property owners could easily report listings that
                                          infringe their rights. It is in growciti's interest to ensure that
                                          infringing products are removed from the site, as they erode Buyer and good
                                          Seller trust.</p>

                                          <li>If you are a Verified Rights Owner and want to report a listing issue, see
                                             growciti's FIV. Note: Only the intellectual property rights owner can
                                             report potentially infringing products or listings through FIV. If you are
                                             not the intellectual property rights owner, you can still help by getting
                                             in touch with the rights owner and encouraging them to contact us.</li>
                                          <li>If your listing was removed through FIV, and you believe that your listing
                                             was removed in error, please contact us.</li>

                                          committed to removing infringing or unlicensed products once an authorized

                                       <p>Overview</p>
                                       <p>Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on growciti. However there
                                          may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Ebuild
                                          Bazaar, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes
                                          between Buyers and Sellers.</p>
                                       <p>What is a 'dispute'?</p>
                                       <p>A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in
                                          connection with a transaction on the Platform.</p>
                                       <p>How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?</p>
                                       <p>Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the
                                          Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not
                                          being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.</p>
                                       <p>It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should
                                          attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a
                                          dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until
                                          the issue is resolved.</p>
                                       <p>How is a 'dispute' created?</p>
                                       <p>Whenever there is a disagreement, the buyer can contact us through this link :
                                          <a href="javascript:void(0);">ebuildbazaar.com</a> , while the Seller can
                                          write to ss@growciti.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be
                                          raised at a particular transaction level.</p>
                                       <p>What are the various types of 'disputes'?</p>
                                       <p>Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:</p>
                                       <ol>
                                          <li>Wrong item received</li>
                                          <li>Item Not as described</li>
                                          <li>Damaged or Seal broken on Product</li>
                                          <li>Part/Accessory missing</li>
                                          <li>Item not Compatible</li>
                                          <li>Seller Description/Specification Wrong</li>
                                          <li>Defective (Functional issues)</li>
                                          <li>Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice</li>
                                       </ol>
                                       <p>In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a
                                          dispute, then growciti will try to mediate and resolve the dispute
                                          between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a

                                          <p>The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous changes
                                             in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries and
                                             institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times have
                                             undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same time, have
                                             led to manifold problems including the problem of massive amount of
                                             hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric products. Such
                                             waste poses a serious threat to human health and environment. The issue of
                                             proper management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to the
                                             protection of livelihood, health and environment.</p>
                                          <p>To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of India,
                                             through its Ministry of Environment and forest, formulated the E-Waste
                                             (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.</p>

                                          <p><strong>The Basel Convention defines wastes as-</strong></p>
                                          <p>“Substances or objects, which are disposed off or are intended to be
                                             disposed off, or are required to be disposed off by the provisions of
                                             national laws”.</p>
                                          <p><strong>E waste has been defined as-</strong></p>
                                          <p>“Waste electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or rejects
                                             from their manufacturing and repair process, which are intended to be
                                             discarded.”</p>
                                          <p>Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:-</p>
                                          <p><em>"Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or
                                                electro-magnetic fields to fully functional".</em></p>
                                          <p>Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an immediate and
                                             long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation and recycling can lead to
                                             major environmental problems endangering human health. This calls for an
                                             urgent need for E-Waste Management so as to preserve the ecological balance
                                             and reduce landfills. Recycling end-of-life products is vital if we are to
                                             save resources and minimize waste. In this regard, we at growciti

                                          <p><strong>Why Recycle.</strong></p>
                                          <p><strong>Conserve Resources</strong></p>
                                          <p>Creation requires raw resources. But when we recycle, extant material is
                                             put to use. Recycling saves this extraction of the fresh raw resources, and
                                             revives the existing ones that are no longer of use. This way there is
                                             lesser exploitation and more conservation of natural resources.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Save Energy</strong></p>
                                          <p>Each time we recycle a product, it requires lesser energy than producing a
                                             new one from the scratch. The considerable difference in manufacturing time
                                             is a result of skipping the usual process of extraction of raw material,
                                             its transportation, refining etc., which is way more than having a market
                                             ready product that to have a raw material ready for production.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Prevent Pollution</strong></p>
                                          <p>Production and disposal of products require a great deal of extraction,
                                             refining, processing and dumping of material, which have larger impact on
                                             the environment. By recycling, we cut down the pollution of air, water and
                                             land, thus reducing the greenhouse gas emission and avoiding any
                                             contribution to global warming.</p>
